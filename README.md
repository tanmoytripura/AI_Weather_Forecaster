# AI Weather Forecaster

This project is an AI-powered weather forecasting application built using Streamlit and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. It consists of two main parts:

1. **Tripura AI Weather Forecaster** - Focuses on weather prediction for the Tripura region.
2. **Weather Prediction** - Provides generalized weather forecasting based on historical data.

## Features
- Uses LSTM for accurate weather forecasting.
- Interactive Streamlit UI for seamless user experience.
- Predicts temperature, humidity, and other weather parameters.
- Supports real-time and historical weather data analysis.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tanmoytripura/AI_Weather_Forecaster.git
   cd ai-weather-forecaster
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage
- Open the Streamlit UI and choose between **Tripura AI Weather Forecaster** or **General Weather Prediction**.
- Input necessary weather data or select real-time data.
- Click **Predict** to get AI-generated forecasts.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- TensorFlow/Keras (LSTM Model)
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## Dataset
The model is trained using historical weather data. Ensure you have a proper dataset in CSV format before running the application.
